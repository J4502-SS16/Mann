Missouri Primary Coverage

When looking for a break down on the Missouri Primary election I looked into our local community paper, the Columbia Missourian and a major state paper, the St. Louis Post Dispatch.
For the Missourian, design is very absent on the site. Virtually every story is pulled from the Associated Press and there are no added visuals to explain the primary process or the outcome. After searching through a few pages of stories I found one Missourian reporter written story on the outcome of Boone County’s votes for the presidential primary. The story includes several pie charts breaking down the result and have a hover feature to show specific numbers. The pie charts, however, are not updated with the final vote count. The article specific to the Missouri primaries has no visuals and the story is AP.
The Post-Dispatch does not have the strongest explanation of the Missouri primary but better than the Missourian. There is a basic image at the top followed by a video from a local broadcast station. The video I found helpful because there is a general breakdown of the way the votes were coming in and being evaluated. The story explains the primaries but doesn’t go too indepth about the situation. The story links to an interactive infographic that breaks down the way each county in Missouri voted but there is no context. There is an added hover feature to show the vote counts. An infographic is available for the other state primaries, along with a national inforgraphic on the landing page of election coverage.
Overall, I would say that the Post-Dispatch has stronger coverage of the primaries. It pulled a lot Associated Press coverage like the Missourian but pulled AP graphics that visually contribute to the text.
